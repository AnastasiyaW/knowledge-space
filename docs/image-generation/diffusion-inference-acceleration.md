# Diffusion Inference Acceleration

There is no portable “speed-up factor” for diffusion inference. A technique can
improve throughput for one checkpoint, resolution, hardware target, and
pipeline while making another slower, less stable, or visually different.
Treat acceleration as a controlled experiment, not as a list of interchangeable
nodes.

## Establish a baseline receipt

Before changing the runtime, record:

- exact model/checkpoint revision, pipeline version, scheduler, and adapters;
- prompt or input fixture, seed, dimensions, batch size, and number of steps;
- GPU, driver, CUDA/PyTorch/runtime versions, and precision;
- cold-start time, warm steady-state latency, peak device memory, and output
  files or hashes; and
- a task-specific fidelity check, including human review where visual
  correctness matters.

Report cold and warm behavior separately. Compilation and caching frequently
move time into the first request, which may be unacceptable for interactive
editing even when repeated jobs become faster.

## Compatible optimization families

Use only a mechanism that is documented for the exact model/runtime pair, and
add one family at a time.

### Compilation

The [Diffusers acceleration guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16)
documents torch.compile for compute-heavy model components. Compilation can pay
off for repeated, shape-stable work, but a changed image size or execution
condition can trigger recompilation. Diffusers also documents regional
compilation for repeated blocks; availability depends on the model
implementation.

### Precision and quantization

Reduced precision or quantized weights can alter memory use, latency, numerical
behavior, and image details. Measure the result against representative inputs;
do not infer fidelity from a precision label. Record the quantizer, base
checkpoint, calibration path when applicable, and loader/runtime version.

### Attention and memory placement

Attention backends may change speed and memory behavior on a particular
hardware stack. CPU or disk offloading primarily solves a memory constraint,
not an unconditional latency problem: the
[memory guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory)
notes that sequential CPU offloading can be extremely slow. Treat offloading,
VAE tiling, and sharding as capacity choices and benchmark them independently.

### Scheduler, step count, and caching

Changing a scheduler or reducing steps changes the sampling procedure. Use the
checkpoint publisher's supported route, then evaluate the requested task rather
than assuming an arbitrary scheduler is compatible. Cache schemes are often
architecture- and implementation-specific; verify their memory cost,
invalidation behavior, and output effect on the target pipeline.

## Measurement protocol

1. Run a fixed baseline after sufficient warm-up and keep the raw receipt.
2. Change one optimization family and repeat the same fixture.
3. Compare median and tail latency, peak memory, output reproducibility, and
   visual/task fidelity.
4. Keep the change only when its measured trade-off satisfies the deployment
   constraint; otherwise revert it.
5. Repeat after changes to the checkpoint, adapters, resolution regime, driver,
   or runtime.

For a public workflow, publish the compatible version tuple and the benchmark
fixture, not a generic performance claim. Do not combine percentage savings
from separate experiments as if they multiply.
